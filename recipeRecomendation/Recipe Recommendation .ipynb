      " Bubble Eclairs 1 recipe Cream Puff Dough, recipe follows, just made and ready to use; Egg wash (1 large egg lightly beaten with a splash of cold water; optional); Double recipe Crackle Top Dough, recipe follows, rolled out, cut into 1-inch rounds and frozen; 1 recipe Streusel, recipe follows; Pearl sugar (available online or at Ikea); Pastry Cream, recipe follows; Whipped Cream, recipe follows; Dark Chocolate Mousse, recipe follows; Ice cream, slightly softened; Confectioners' sugar, for dusting (optional); Serving suggestion: bittersweet chocolate sauce or hot or cold caramel sauce; 1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk; 1/2 cup (120 ml) water; 1 stick (8 tablespoons; 4 ounces; 113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces; 1 tablespoon sugar; 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt; 1 cup (136 grams) all-purpose flour; 4 large eggs, at room temperature; 4 1/2 tablespoons (2 1/4 ounces; 64 grams) unsalted butter; 1/2 cup (100 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar; Pinch of fine sea salt; 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (85 grams) all-purpose flour; 3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract; 3/4 cup (102 grams) all-purpose flour; 1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar; 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt; 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons; 3 ounces; 85 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes; 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract; 1 moist, fragrant vanilla bean, or 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract; 2 cups (480 ml) whole milk; 6 large egg yolks; 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar; 1/3 cup (43 grams) cornstarch, sifted; 3 1/2 tablespoons (1 3/4 ounces; 50 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 6 chunks; 1 cup (240 ml) very cold heavy cream; 1 to 4 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, sifted; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional); 1 3/4 cups (420 ml) very cold heavy cream; 2 large eggs, at room temperature; 4 large egg yolks, at room temperature; 10 ounces (283 grams) bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped; 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar; 3 tablespoons water To make the eclairs: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\n",
      "There are several ways to shape your bubble eclairs. Usually I portion the dough with a small cookie scoop (one with a capacity of 2 teaspoons), but you can pipe the dough from a pastry bag with a plain or open star tip, which makes squiggles and swirls that look lovely when baked. You might want to make it simple and just use a zipper-lock plastic bag as a piping bag.\n",
      "No matter what you use, you want to scoop or pipe 3 balls of dough as close to one another as you can get them for each eclair. If you're scooping, scoop 1 ball, then crowd it with the second-giving it a little nudge-and then scoop out the last bubble, snuggling it up to the second ball of dough. When you've got 3 bubbles in a row, move on to the next eclair, making sure to leave at least 2 inches of puff-and-grow space between the clusters. If you're piping, the principle is the same.\n",
      "Now you have to make some decisions about the topping. If you're going to top the bubbles with disks of crackle, there's no need to give them an egg wash. Just lay a circle of the Crackle Top Dough on each puff of dough.\n",
      "If you'd like to top the eclairs with Streusel or pearl sugar, then it's nice to give each puff a swipe of egg wash. Make an effort to keep the egg wash on the top of the puffs and not let it drip down the sides; it's not fatal, but it does hamper the even rise of the pate a choux. If you're using Streusel, break up the pieces with your fingertips and use a smidge on each puff-put it on and press it down very, very lightly. If you're using pearl sugar, go to town-it's nice to have that crunch.\n",
      "Slide the baking sheet into the oven and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 375 degrees F. Bake the eclairs for 20 minutes without opening the oven door, then rotate the pan and continue to bake the pastries for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden on top and bottom and firm to the touch. Transfer the eclairs to a rack to cool to room temperature.\n",
      "To fill the eclairs: There are two traditional ways to fill eclairs, both good and both fun. One is to fill a pastry bag with whatever you've chosen as a filling, use a medium plain pastry tip to poke a hole in the eclair-either in the bottom or in one side-nuzzle the tip into the hole and squeeze in enough filling to come to the edges of the hole.\n",
      "The other way is to slice the eclairs horizontally, either in half or by cutting off the top one third. If you do this, you can scoop out the (inevitable) eggy innards. Some people love the custard interior, some don't, so know thyself (and thine audience). Pipe, spoon or scoop the filling into the bottom of the eclairs and cap with the tops.\n",
      "No matter how you've filled the pastries, they should be served immediately or stowed in the refrigerator until needed.\n",
      "If you haven't sugared or crackled your eclairs, you might want to give them a last-minute dusting of confectioners' sugar.\n",
      "Serving: There's no law that says you can't pass these around and let everyone eat them out of hand, but I think of them as knife-and-fork pastries. If you serve them with cutlery you might want to serve them with bittersweet chocolate sauce or hot or cold salted caramel sauce.\n",
      "Bring the milk, water, butter, sugar and salt to a rapid boil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat. Add the flour all at once, lower the heat to medium-low and quickly start stirring energetically with a wooden spoon or sturdy heatproof spatula. The dough will come together and a light crust will form on the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring vigorously for another minute or two to dry the dough. The dough should be very smooth.\n",
      "Turn the dough out into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or into a large bowl in which you can use a hand mixer or a wooden spoon. Let the dough sit for 3 minutes, then add the eggs one by one, beating until the dough is thick and shiny. Make sure that each egg is fully incorporated before you add the next, and don't be concerned if the dough falls apart; by the time the last egg goes in, it will have come together again. The dough should be used immediately.\n",
      "Remove the butter from the refrigerator 10 minutes before you're ready to make the dough.\n",
      "After 10 minutes, cut the butter into small cubes and toss it and the brown sugar and salt into a food processor. Process until almost blended. Add the flour and pulse until the dough forms moist curds. Pulse in the vanilla.\n",
      "Scrape the dough onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and shape it into a disk. Cover with another piece of parchment or wax paper and roll the dough out so that it's about 1/16th inch thick. Slide the dough, still between the paper, onto a cutting board and freeze it for at least 2 hours. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months, in which case it should be wrapped airtight.)\n",
      "Put the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl and mix everything together by running the ingredients through your fingers. Drop in the butter and squeeze and rub the cubes into the mixture until you have a sandy mix. If you press a little streusel together, you'll get lumps, which is just what you want. Drizzle the vanilla over the streusel and toss, squeeze and rub to distribute it. Cover the bowl and chill the streusel until needed. (You can make the streusel up to 1 week ahead; pack it in an airtight container and keep it refrigerated.)\n",
      "If using a vanilla bean, cut it in half lengthwise and use the tip of the knife to scrape out the pulpy seeds. Bring the milk and vanilla bean pulp and pod to a boil in a medium saucepan. (If you're using extract, you'll add it later.) Cover the pan, turn off the heat and let infuse for at least 10 minutes, or for up to 1 hour.\n",
      "Return the milk to a boil if you've used a vanilla bean; bring it to a boil if you're using extract.\n",
      "Whisk the yolks, sugar and cornstarch together in a medium heatproof bowl until blended. Whisking constantly, drizzle in one quarter of the hot milk to temper, or warm, the yolks. Still whisking, add the remainder of the liquid in a steady stream. Remove the pod (if you have it), pour the mixture into the saucepan and, whisking vigorously and constantly, bring to a boil over medium heat. Keep at a boil-never stop whisking-for 1 to 2 minutes, then press the cream through a sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla extract, if you're using it.\n",
      "Leave the pastry cream on the counter for 10 minutes, then whisk in the butter until it is fully incorporated and the pastry cream is smooth and silky.\n",
      "Either press a piece of plastic film against the surface of the cream and refrigerate it until it's thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours, or fill a large bowl with ice cubes and cold water, set the bowl of pastry cream in it and leave the cream there, stirring occasionally, until it's cold. Use now, or cover and refrigerate until needed.\n",
      "Storing: The pastry cream can be kept tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Whisk it well to loosen it before using.\n",
      "Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer or a balloon whip, beat the cream and 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar together just until the cream starts to thicken. Taste and add more sugar, if you'd like, then continue to beat until you get the thickness you want. I use my stand mixer and start off slow, then increase the speed and when the cream is almost whipped the way I want it, I finish it by hand with a whisk. Hand finishing reduces the risk of overbeating and turning your cream into sweetened butter. When the cream is just right, stir in the vanilla extract, if you're using it.\n",
      "Storing: Whipped cream is best served soon after it's made, but it will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for a few hours. Give it a go-round with a whisk just before serving. To keep the cream longer- or to get a thicker cream- line a strainer with a piece of moistened cheesecloth, place the strainer over a bowl and put the cream in the strainer. Wrap the whole setup in plastic film and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.\n",
      "Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a heavy-duty hand mixer, beat the cream until it holds medium-firm peaks. If you're working in a stand mixer, transfer the cream to another bowl and rinse and dry the mixer bowl and whisk. Cover the whipped cream and refrigerate.\n",
      "Put the eggs and yolks in the mixer bowl and fit the machine with the whisk attachment, or work in another large bowl with the hand mixer. Beat the eggs at low speed just to break them up. Set aside while you prepare the chocolate and syrup.\n",
      "Melt the chocolate in a microwave oven or in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the heat isn't too high and that the chocolate remains thick and shiny. If necessary, scrape the chocolate into a bowl that's large enough to hold all the ingredients for the mousse; set aside. The chocolate must cool (114 degrees F is the ideal temperature) so that when you fold in the cold whipped cream, it doesn't seize and clump.\n",
      "Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Swirl the pan to mix the ingredients as they start to heat, and if some of the sugar spatters on the sides of the pan, wash it down with a silicone pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook the sugar over high heat until it reaches 257 degrees F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes (or maybe a little more, depending on the dimensions of your pan and the heat you have under it).\n",
      "Back to the eggs: Beat the eggs on the lowest speed, just to get them moving again, then very slowly pour in the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to pour the syrup between the side of the bowl and the whirring whisk. Please be careful-this is soooooooo hot and sticky! No matter how careful you are, you'll get spatters and you should just leave them-trying to scrape them into the eggs will only produce lumps. When all the syrup is in the bowl, up the mixer speed to high and beat until the eggs are pale and more than doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. If the eggs have doubled but still feel warm, lower the mixer speed to medium and keep beating until they reach room temperature.\n",
      "Pull the whipped cream from the refrigerator and give it a couple of rounds with a whisk, just to bring back the medium-firm peaks. Working with a large flexible spatula, fold about one quarter of the whipped cream into the chocolate to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest of the cream. Now, using the spatula and your lightest touch, fold in the whipped eggs. Your voluminous eggs will deflate some, but be gentle and the texture of your mousse will be lovely.\n",
      "Use the mousse now if you're filling a cake with it, but if you want to pipe it, it's best to cover and chill it for at least 1 hour. And if you are serving it on its own, chill it.\n",
      "Serving: The mousse can be served elegantly in small cups or bowls, topped with a rosette of unsweetened whipped cream, or family style, as it's often served in French homes.\n",
      "Storing: The mousse can be covered tightly and kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. \n",

      " Lucerne Cheese Torte 1 cup sifted cake flour; 1 tablespoon granulated sugar; 1/8 teaspoon salt; 2 tablespoons unsalted butter; 4 large eggs, room temperature; 1/2 cup granulated sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 1/4 cups water; 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar; 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, strained; 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature; 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature; 1 tablespoon sour cream; 1 teaspoon lemon zest; 2 large egg yolks; 2 tablespoons water; 1/4 cup granulated sugar; 1/4 cup heavy cream For the cake: Position rack in lower third of over 5 to 6 inches from the bottom and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease the bottom and sides of a 8-inch round pan with solid shortening. Dust generously with flour, tilt to distribute, then tap out excess, and insert a parchment or waxed paper liner.\n",
      "Pour the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt in that order into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the sugar evenly and to remove any lumps in the flour, set aside. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Pour into a 1 quart mixing bowl, and set aside.\n",
      "Crack the eggs into the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Add the 1/2 cup sugar, and whisk by hand to combine. Rest the bowl in a shallow pan, such as a 10 inch skillet, filled with 1-inch of water that feels hot to the touch (120 degrees). To prevent the eggs from setting, whisk them continuously for about 30 seconds. Now test if the mixture has warmed to body temperature, taking care that it does not exceed 110 degrees.\n",
      "Attach the bowl to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on medium speed (#5) until the mixture has cooled and increased considerably in volume (tripled or more), appears light in texture and almost white in color, and has thickened to the consistency of a whole egg meringue (about 3 to 4 minutes). Pour in the vanilla during the final moments of whipping. Test if it is time to fold in the flour by lifting the whisk. If some of the mixture falls back into the bowl in ribbons and remains on the surface, proceed. But if it sinks back into the batter right away, continue whipping for a few more minutes, or until the desired consistency is achieved. Then remove the bowl and its whisk from the mixer.\n",
      "With the aid of a flexible metal icing spatula, scoop up one third of the flour mixture, and sprinkle it over the top. Using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture into the batter just until incorporated. Repeat procedure two more times, folding just until all the flour has been absorbed.\n",
      "Gently pour about 1 cup of the batter into the melted butter, and with the rubber spatula, fold until combined. Return the butter mixture to reserved batter, and again fold to combine.\n",
      "Gently pour the mixture into the pan, taking care not to deflate the foam structure you have created. With a rubber spatula, smooth the top of the batter, working from the center outward, until a slightly raised ridge forms around the outside rim. (Since the cake bakes faster near the metal rim, mounding the batter around the edges assures a more evenly baked layer.) Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or until the top springs back slightly when lightly touched, sounding spongy when tapped, and the sides begin to contract from the pan.\n",
      "Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With mitts, tilt and rotate the pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the metal sides. If not, or if in doubt, run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between the outside cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and allowing air to get under the layer as it is rotated. Cover the pan with another cooking rack, invert it onto that rack, and carefully lift the pan from the cake to remove. Slowly peel off the parchment liner, turn it over so that the sticky side faces up, and reposition it on top of the cake. Cover with the first rack, invert the layer right side up, and remove the top rack. Allow cake to cool completely.\n",
      "If you plan to assemble a dessert later in the day or the next, leave the genoise out, uncovered, on a rack to airdry. (Most genoises benefit from slight staling since they will absorb the dessert syrup more easily.) The theory behind using dessert syrup is twofold: It makes it possible to keep the dessert longer, and it adds to a complexity of flavors.)\n",
      "For the syrup: Pour the water into a 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Add the sugar; stir to blend; then bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate up to 6 months.\n",
      "Combine the Soaking Syrup and lemon juice in a liquid cup measure. Set aside.\n",
      "For the filling: In a 2 to 3 quart mixing bowl, manipulate the cream cheese with a rubber spatula until smooth. Gradually add the butter, stirring until smooth and homogeneous. Lastly, stir in the sour cream and lemon zest; set aside. Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and with the whisk attachment, whip them on medium speed (#5) until light in color and fluffy in texture (about 2 minutes). Detach whisk and remove bowl; set whisk close by to use later. Combine the water and sugar in a heavybottomed saucepan or sugar pot. Place over low heat, swirling the pot occasionally to distribute heat until the sugar completely dissolves (about 2 minutes). Keep a pastry brush in a small glass of water to wash down any sugar crystals that form along the sides of the pot. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, increase heat to high and boil until it registers 238 degrees (soft ball stage) on a mercury candy thermometer (about 5 minutes). Quickly pour the syrup into the center of the whipped yolks and whisk vigorously by hand to combine, using the mixer's whisk attachment. Reattach the bowl and its whisk to the mixer and whip on medium speed (#5) until the egg yolk mixture thickens, increases in volume, lightens in color and texture and cools to room temperature (about 4 minutes). Whisk into the cream cheese mixture until blended smoothly. Whip the heavy cream in a deep 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Then fold into cream cheese buttercream. The consistency is soft and thin, but after refrigeration, the cream cheese and fat become firm to give the filling body and texture. Yield: 1 1/2 cups\n",
      "Cutting the Cake:\n",
      "The genoise is cut in such a fashion that its exterior is left intact, but a core is removed. Imagine a 1/2-inch thick border around the outside edge of the cake. Now, using the tip of a shortbladed paring knife, cut along the imaginary line with a sawing motion around the entire cake, stopping short of the cake's bottom by 1/2-inch. Loosen the 6 1/2-inch circle or inner core of the cake without disturbing the outer shell. Using a small serrated knife, such as a tomato knife, insert the blade into the side of the cake 1/2-inch from the bottom, creating a small slit. Keeping the knife horizontal and level, pivot the serrated edge in one direction, trying not to cut through the outer shell of cake. (This will eventually loosen the entire bottom of the inner core.)\n",
      "Remove the knife, insert it back into the slit with the serrated edge facing the opposite direction, and pivot the other way. Repeat three more times, rotating the cake a quarter turn each time. After completing four cuts, you should have loosened the core sufficiently to lift it out. Test it gently with a fork around the edge of the core; if you meet resistance anywhere, insert the serrated knife back into the nearest slit, and pivot the blade again. Be patient and keep pivoting as well as tracing the top circle, and soon you'll be able to lift the core with the aid of the fork.\n",
      "Remove the center core of the cake; it should measure about 6 1/2 to 7 inches in diameter and be about 1-inch thick. Place the core on a flat work surface. Mentally divide it in half horizontally. Now, using the paring knife, cut all the way around the side of the cake about 1/2-inch deep on that imaginary line. Slide a 12-inch knife into the cut. Holding the knife steady in that path, rotate the cake in a circle into the knife blade, cutting in a slow sawing motion all around, until the cake is evenly split into two 1/2-inch thick layers.\n",
      "Remove the top 1/2-inch layer, wrap it in plastic, and save for future use. Split the remaining 1/2- inch layer into two 1/4-inch thick layers, using the same cutting procedure as above. Remove the top 1/4-inch layer and set aside. (Use a removable quiche bottom to aid in lifting, if necessary.) \n",

      " Boston Trifle 1 cup sifted cake flour; 7 tablespoons granulated sugar; 7 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar; 7 large eggs, room temperature; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 teaspoon cream of tartar; 1 1/3 cups half and half; 1/2 cup granulated sugar; 4 egg yolks; 1/4 cup unsifted all purpose flour; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 teaspoon dark rum; 1 cup (8 ounces) heavy cream; 4 ounces semisweet chocolate; 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate; 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 300 degrees. Pour the flour and 7 tablespoons of sugar in that order into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper, and set aside. (Sifting the two together disperses and separates the particles of flour so that when dry ingredients are added later to the batter, folding in the flour is easier and more efficient, requiring less folding to incorporate. Measure the additional 7 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar; set aside.\n",
      "Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a heavyduty mixer and yolks in a 1 1/2 quart bowl. (A deep bowl this size makes it more efficient for whipping the yolks thoroughly since it minimizes the surface area.) With an electric hand mixer, whip the yolks on high speed (#10) for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vanilla, and continue whipping for 15 seconds to incorporate; the mixture should appear thicker, pale yellow, and increased in volume. Test the consistency by lifting some of the mixture with the beaters. If it flows back into the bowl in ribbons that slowly dissolve on the surface, proceed to whipping the whites. But if the ribbons sink into the surface immediately, continue whipping until the yolks have the desired consistency.\n",
      "Attach the bowl of whites to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on mediumlow speed (#3) for 30 to 45 seconds to break them up. When small bubbles appear and the surface is frothy, stop the machine, and sprinkle the cream of tartar and the 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in the center. Resume whipping, increasing speed to medium (#5), for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the whites appear glossy and stiff but not dry or granular.\n",
      "Detach the whisk and bowl, tapping the whisk against the side of the bowl with enough force to free the excess. Pour the yolks onto the whites (notice they float on the surface). Using just a few strokes, fold the two together with a rubber spatula. Don't be concerned if some of the yolks remain visible. Sprinkle half of 7 tablespoons sugar over the surface, and fold to incorporate. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar, folding again to incorporate.\n",
      "With the aid of a metal spatula, scoop a third of the flour, and sprinkle it over the egg mixture; with a rubber spatula, fold to incorporate. Repeat two more times, folding just until incorporated after each addition.\n",
      "Gently pour batter into an ungreased 9-inch springform pan with the aid of a rubber spatula and smooth the surface level. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until the top is golden. (The batter hardly rises during the first 20 to 30 minutes of baking. The low oven temperature allows the batter to absorb heat slowly, so rising is gradual. Toward the end of baking the cake may mound high above the pan's rim. That's fine. As it cools, this dome will contract a bit.) When finished baking, the cake should feel spongy, springing back slightly upon being lightly touched. A toothpick, inserted in the center, comes out free of cake. The toothpick is the last test for this cake before you judge if it is finished baking and remove it from the oven. If in doubt, baking 5 to 7 more minutes will not harm the cake.\n",
      "Remove spongecake from the oven, and immediately turn it upside down, positioning the edges of the pan on the inverted glasses. This position, defying gravity, allows the cake to maintain its spongy structure without deflating while cooling. Cool the cake for 2 hours; then turn the pan right side up, and place it on the counter. Though the cake is cool to the touch, let it sit for at least 1 more hour to cool the inside completely. (The cake's structure is less fragile when cool, making removal easier.) To release the spongecake and maintain its shape perfectly, remove it from the pan as follows: Carefully loosen the cake crust that is stuck to the top rim of the pan; insert a thin metal spatula down 1/8 inch, and loosen and free the crust all around the cake. Then tilt and rotate pan, tapping it gently on the counter to free the sponge from the metal sides. Tap more if it is not completely released. Finally, release the spring mechanism, and slowly remove the rim. (You'll notice the cake seemed to have had a slipcover because a thin, crusty layer of cake remains on the springform rim; it's delicious, too.) Now tilt the cake on its side, and gently tap the metal bottom on the counter. Rotate the cake as you tap until the removable bottom appears free. Additional tapping may be necessary before it comes off completely. Patience will ensure a perfectly shaped cake.\n",
      "For the filling: Pour the half and half into a 1 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan, add the 1/2 cup sugar, and stir to combine. In a 1 quart bowl whisk the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar to combine. Add the flour, and whisk to combine. Bring the half and half mixture just to a boil over medium heat. Remove, and pour half of the hot liquid over the yolk mixture, whisking to combine. Pour the yolk mixture into saucepan, and over medium heat bring it to a boil again, stirring constantly. When it is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat, pour it into a 3 quart mixing bowl to cool, and cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming on the cream. (This bowl size is to allow room for folding in the whipped cream later.) Pierce the plastic with the tip of a knife to let steam escape and cool faster. Refrigerate.\n",
      "For the glaze: Chop the chocolate into matchstick size pieces with a chef's knife on a dry cutting board. Place first the butter, then the chocolate pieces in the top portion of a 1 1/2 quart double boiler (or a 1 quart mixing bowl that fits snugly over a saucepan or another mixing bowl). Fill the bottom vessel half full with hot tap water (120130 degrees) and place the chocolate/butter bowl on top to melt. You may put the double boiler on the stove over a very low flame just to maintain the water's temperature while melting the mixture if you wish. Stir occasionally to blend until the mixture is smooth, shiny and liquid. Remove from the water, and set aside. Yield: One scant cup.\n",
      "Assembling the Trifle: Split the spongecake evenly into three layers, each about 7/8-inch thick, using a 12inch serrated knife in a sawing motion. Lift the top two layers, one at a time, and set aside (this is easy because each layer is spongy and thick). Stir the vanilla and rum into the cold custard. Whip the heavy cream in a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl to the Chantilly stage, and fold into the custard mixture. Place the bottom cake layer of cake in a 2 1/2 to 3 quart glass bowl, and cover it with half of the filling, spreading evenly with a rubber spatula. Center the middle layer on top, and cover it with the remaining filling. Center the last layer on top. Cover the dessert with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\n",
      "Spoon 1 cup of the Chocolate Butter Glaze into a 1 quart bowl over a bowl of hot tap water (120 to 130 degrees). Stir until liquid and smooth. Spread the glaze over the top of the dessert evenly with a metal or rubber spatula. With a 2inch paring knife, scrape the tip of the blade firmly but gently down a bar of chocolate. If the chocolate's surface area is cool, you will get fine flakes; if it's slightly warm, the shapes will be very small corkscrews. Sprinkle Chocolate Flakes around the rim of the dessert. Refrigerate for up to 1 to 2 hours before serving. \n",

      " Plain French Bread (Pain Français)  Unless you plan to go into the more elaborate simulation of a baker's oven, you need no unusual equipment for the following recipe. Here are the requirements, some of which may sound odd but will explain themselves when you read the recipe.; A 4- to 5-quart mixing bowl with fairly vertical rather than outward-slanting sides; A kneading surface of some sort, 1 1/2 to 2 square feet; A rubber spatula and either a metal scraper or a stiff wide metal spatula; 1 or 2 unwrinkled canvas pastry cloths or stiff linen towels upon which the dough may rise; A stiff piece of cardboard or plywood 18 to 20 inches long and 6 to 8 inches wide, for unmolding dough from canvas to baking sheet; Finely ground cornmeal, or pasta pulverized in an electric blender, to sprinkle on unmolding board so as to prevent dough from sticking; The largest baking sheet that will fit into your oven; A razor blade for slashing the top of the dough; A soft pastry brush or fine-spray atomizer for moistening dough before and during baking; A room temperature thermometer to verify rising-temperature; 3 long loaves, baguettes, 24 by 2 inches; Or bâtards, 16 by 3 inches; Or 6 short loaves, ficelles, 12 to 16 by 2 inches; Or 3 round loaves, boules, 7 to 8 inches in diameter; Or 12 round or oval rolls, petits pains; Or 1 large round or oval loaf, pain de ménage or miche; pain boulot; 1 cake (0.6 ounce) fresh yeast or 1 package dry-active yeast; 1/3 cup warm water (not over 100 degrees) in a measure; 3 1/2 cups (about 1 lb.) all-purpose flour, measured by scooping dry-measure cups into flour and sweeping off excess; 2 1/4 tsp salt; 1 1/4 cups tepid water (70 to 74 degrees) 1) The dough mixturele fraisage (or frasage) Stir the yeast in the warm water and let liquefy completely while measuring flour into mixing bowl. When yeast has liquefied, pour it into the flour along with the salt and the rest of the water. NOTE: We do not find the food processor satisfactory here, since the dough is so soft the machine clogs; however, you can use a heavy-duty mixer with dough hook, and finish it up by hand. _Stir and cut the liquids into the flour with a rubber spatula, pressing firmly to form a dough, and making sure that all bits of flour and unmassed pieces are gathered in._Turn the dough out onto kneading surface, scraping bowl clean. Dough will be soft and sticky. Let it rest for 2 to 3 minutes while you wash and dry the bowl.\n",

      "2) Kneadingpétrissage The flour will have absorbed the liquid during this short rest, and the dough will have a little more cohesion for the kneading that is about to begin. Use one hand only for kneading and keep the other clean to hold a pastry scraper, to dip out extra flour, to answer the telephone, and so forth. Your object in kneading is to render the dough perfectly smooth and to work it sufficiently so that all the gluten molecules are moistened and joined together into an interlocking web. You cannot see this happen, of course, but you can feel it because the dough will become elastic and will retract into shape when you push it out. Start kneading by lifting the near edge of the dough, using a pastry scraper or stiff wide spatula to help you if necessary, and flipping dough over onto itself. Scrape the dough off the surface and slap it down; lift edge and flip it over again, repeating the movement rapidly. In 2 to 3 minutes the dough should have enough body so that you can give it a quick forward push with the heel of your hand as you flip it over. Continue to knead rapidly and vigoursly in this way. If it remains too sticky, knead in a sprinkling of flour. (Whole kneading process will take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how vigourous and expert you become.) Shortly after this point, the dough should have developed enough elasticity so that it draws back into shape when pushed, indicating the the gluten molecules haved united and are under tension like a thin web of rubber; the dough should also begin to clean itself off the kneading surface, although it will stick to your fingers if you hold a pinch for more than a minute or two. Let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Knead again for a minute: the surface should now look smooth; the dough will be less sticky but it will still remain soft. It is now ready for its first rise.\n",

      "3) First risingpointage premier temps (3 to 5 hours at around 70 degrees) You now have approximately 3 cups of dough that is to rise 3 1/2 times its original volume, or to about 10 1/2 cups. Fill the mixing bowl about 10 1/2 cups of tepid water and make a mark to indicate that the level on the outside of the bowl (note that the bowl should have fairly upright sides; if they are too outward slanting, the dough will have difficulty rising). Pour out the water, dry the bowl, and place the dough in it; slip bowl into a large plastic bag or cover with plastic, and top with a folded bath towel. Set on a wooden surface (marble or stone are too cold) or on a folded towel or pillow, and let rise free from drafts anyplace where the temperature is around 70 degrees; if the room is too hot, set bowl in water and keep renewing water to maintain it at around 70 degrees. Dough should take at least 3 hours to rise to 10 1/2 cups; if the temperature is lower, it will simply take longer. (*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe. When fully risen, the dough will be humped into a slight dome, showing that the yeast is still active; it will be light and spongy when pressed. There will be usually be some big bubbly blisters on the surface, and if you are using a glass bowl you will see bubbles through the glass.\n",

      "4) Deflating and second risingrupture; pointage deuxième temps (1 1/2 to 2 hours at around 70 degrees) The dough is now ready to be deflated, which will release the yeast-engendered gases and redistribute the yeast cells so that the dough will rise again and continue the fermentation process. With a rubber spatula dislodge dough from inside of the bowl and turn out onto a lightly floured surface, scraping the bowl clean. If dough seems damp and sweaty, sprinkle with a tablespoon of flour. Lightly flour the palms of your hands and flatten the dough firmly but not too roughly into a circle, deflating any gas bubble by pinching them. Lift a corner of the near side and flip it down onto the far side. Do the same with the left side, then the right side. Finally lift the near side and tuck it just under the edge of the far side. The mass of dough will look like a rounded cushion. Slip the sides of your hands under the dough and return it to the bowl. Cover and let rise again, this time to not quite triple, but again until it is dome-shaped and light and spongy when touched. (*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe.\n",

      "5) Cutting and resting dough before forming loaves Loosen dough all around inside of bowl and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Because of its two long rises, the dough will have much more body. If it seems damp and sweaty, sprinkle lightly with flour. Making clean, sure cuts with a large knife or a scarper, divide dough into 3 equal pieces for long loaves, or whatever is specified for other shapes and sizes. After you have cut each piece, lift one end and flip it over onto the opposite end to fold and flip it over onto the opposite end to fold the dough in two; place dough at far side of kneading surface. Cover loosely with a sheet of plastic and let rest for 5 minutes before forming. This relaxes the gluten enough for shaping, but not long enough for the dough to begin rising again. While the dough is resting, prepare the rising surface: smooth the canvas or linen toweling on a large tray or baking sheet, and rub flour thoroughly into the entire surface of the cloth to prevent the dough from sticking.\n",

      "6) Forming loavesla tourne; la mise en forme des pâtons Because French bread stands free in the oven and it is not baked in a pan, it has to be formed in such a way that tension of the coagulated gluten cloak on the surface will hold the dough in shape. Following are illustrated directions for the familiar long loaf—the bâtards (baked size 16 by 3 inches); other shapes are described and illustrated at the end of the recipe. Baguettes are much too long for home ovens. After the 3 pieces of dough have rested 5 minutes, form one piece at a time, keeping the remaining one covered. Working rapidly, turn the dough upside down on a lightly floured kneading surface and pat it firmly but not too roughly into an 8-to 10-inch oval with the lightly floured palms of your hands. Deflate any gas bubbles in the dough by pinching them. Fold the dough in half lengthwise by bringing the far edge down over the near edge. Being sure that the working surface is always very lightly floured so the dough will not stick and tear, which would break the lightly coagulated gluten cloak that is being formed, seal the edges of the dough together, your hands extended, thumbs out at right angles and touching. Roll the dough a quarter turn forward so the seal is on top. Flatten the dough again into an oval with the palms of your hands. Press a trench along the central length of the oval with the side of one hand. Fold in half again lengthwise. This time seal the edges together with the heel of one hand, and roll the dough a quarter turn toward you so the seal is on the bottom. Now, by rolling the dough back and forth with the palms of your hands, you will lengthen it into a sausage shape. Start in the middle, placing your right palm on the dough, and your left palm on top of your right hand. Roll dough forward and backward rapidly, gradually sliding your hands toward the two ends as the dough lengthens. Deflate any gas blisters on the surface by pinching them. Repeat the rolling movement rapidly several times until the dough is 16 inches long, or whatever length will fit on your baking sheet. During the extention rolls, keep circumference of dough as even as possible and try to start each roll with sealed side of dough down, twisting the rope of dough to straighten the line of seal as necessary. If seal disappears, as it sometimes does with all-purpose flour, do not worry. Place the shaped piece of dough, sealed side up, at one side of the flour-rubbed canvas, leaving a free end of canvas 3 to 4 inches wide. (The top will crust slightly as the dough rises; it is turned over for baking so the soft, smooth underside will be uppermost.) Pinch a ridge 2 1/2 to 3 inches high in the canvas to make a trough, and a place for the next piece. Cover dough with plastic while you are forming the rest of the loaves. After all the pieces of dough are in place, brace the two sides of the canvas with long rolling pins, baking pans, or books, if the dough seems very soft and wants to spread out. Cover the dough loosely with a flour-rubbed dish towel or canvas, and a sheet of plastic. Proceed immediately to the final rising, next step.\n",

      "7) Final risel'apprêt1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours at around 70 degrees The covered dough is now to rise to almost triple in volume; look carefully at its pre-risen size so that you will be able to judge correctly. It will be light and swollen when risen, but will feel still a little springy when pressed. It is important that the final rise take place where it is dry; if your kitchen is damp, hot, and steamy, let the bread rise in another room or dough will stick to canvas and you will have difficulty getting it off and onto the baking sheet. It will turn into bread in the oven whatever happens, but you will have an easier time and a better loaf if you aim for ideal conditions. Preheat oven to 450 degrees 30 minutes before estimated baking time. (*) DELAYED ACTION: See chart at end of recipe.\n",

      "8) Unmolding risen dough onto baking sheetle démoulage The 3 pieces of risen dough are now to be unmolded from the canvas and arranged upside down on the baking sheet. The reason for this reversal is that the present top of the dough has crusted over during its rise; the smooth, soft underside should be uppermost in the oven so that the dough can expand and allow the loaf its final puff of volume. For the unmolding you will need a non-sticking intermediate surface such as stiff piece of cardboard or plywood sprinkled with cornmeal or pulverized pasta. Remove rolling pins or braces. Place the long side of the board at one side of the dough; pull the edge of the canvas to flatten it; then raise and flip the dough softly upside down onto the board. Dough is now lying along one edge of the umolding board: rest this edge on the right side of a lightly buttered baking sheet. Gently dislodge dough onto baking sheet, keeping same side of dough uppermost: this is the soft smooth side, which was underneath while dough rose on canvas. If necessary, run sides of hands lightly down the length of the dough to straighten it. Unmold the next piece of dough the same way, placing it to the left of the first, leaving a 3-inch space. Unmold the final piece near the left side of the sheet.\n",

Unmold the final piece near the left side of the sheet.\n",
      "9) Slashing top of the doughla coupe The top of each piece of dough is now to be slashed in several places. This opens the covering cloak of gluten and allows a bulge of dough underneath to swell up through the cuts during the first 10 minutes of baking, making decorative patterns in the crust. These are done with a blade that cuts almost horizontally into the dough to a depth of less than half an inch. Start the cut at the middle of the blade, drawing toward you in a swift, clean sweep. This is not quite as easy as it sounds, and you will probably make ragged cuts at first; never mind, you will improve with practice. Use an ordinary razor blade and slide one side of it into a cork for safety; or buy a barber's straight razor at a cutlery store. For a 16- to 18-inch loaf make 3 slashes. Note that those at the 2 ends go straight down the loaf but are slightly off center, while the middle slash is at a slight angle between the two. Make the first cut at the far end, then the middle cut, and finally the third. Remember that the blade should lie almost parallel to the surface of the dough.\n",

      "10) Bakingabout 25 minutes; oven preheated to 450 degrees As soon as the dough has been slashed, moisten the surface either by painting with a soft brush dipped in cold water, or with a fine-spray atomizer, and slide baking sheet onto rack in upper third of preheated oven. Rapidly paint or spray dough with cold water after 3 minutes, again in 3 minutes, and a final time 3 minutes later. Moistening the dough at this point helps the crust to brown and allows the yeast action to continue in the dough a little longer. The bread should be done in about 25 minutes; the crust will be crisp, and the bread will make a hollow sound when thumped. If you want the crust to shine, paint lightly with a brush dipped in cold water as soon as you slide baking sheet out of the oven.\n",

      "11) Cooling2 to 3 hours Cool the bread on a rack or set it upright in a basket or large bowl so that air can circulate freely around each piece. Although bread is always exciting to eat fresh from the oven, it will have a much better taste when the inside is thoroughly cool and has composed itself.\n",

      "12) Storing French Bread Because it contains no fat or preservatives of any kind, French bread is at its best when eaten the day it is baked. It will keep for a day or two longer, wrapped airtight and refrigerated, but it will keep best if you freeze it—let the loaves cool first, then wrap airtight. To thaw, unwrap and place on a baking sheet in a cold oven; heat the oven to 400 degrees. In about 20 minutes the crush will be hot and crisp, and the bread thawed. The French, of course, never heat French bread except possibly on Monday, the baker's holiday, when the bread is a day old.\n",

      " Pasta All'uovo (Egg Dough)  1 pound (450 grams) sifted all-purpose flour (farina 00); 5 medium or large eggs, or 4 extra-large or jumbo; extra flour for dusting and adjusting Hand method: Sift the flour onto a large wooden board. Form the flour into a mound with the approximate profile of Mount Fuji. Form your hand into a loose fist, and, with the back of the fingers, gently ream out the center of the mound until you have something that resembles a low, broad volcano with a very deep crater. Italian cooks call this a fountain, fontana, for the pool of liquid in the center, but it's definitely a cone. Break all the eggs into the crater one by one. Pierce the yolks with a fork and begin gingerly to use the fork to incorporate them into the flour with a movement something like scrambling eggs. Incorporate the liquid from the center outward. The walls of the crater will keep the liquid from running out. When the liquid has absorbed enough flour that you now have a messy, wet dough surrounded by flour, knock what's left of the volcano in toward the center and begin to knead with your hands to incorporate the rest of the flour into the dough. Scrape up all the remaining flour and the dough bits and squeeze them into the dough.\n",

      "Kneading: The biggest mistake people make, says Oretta, is not using enough force. Skip the gym the day you make pasta and make kneading your workout. The women of Scandriglia, where Oretta has her country house, recommend making fettuccine as a remedy for backache in preference to those boring exercises. On the other hand, my friend Antonietta, who learned to make pasta as a child in Basilicata, tells me southern men enjoy watching the undulating hips of southern women as they knead the pasta dough. If it helps to put on some music and do the maccheroni mambo as you knead, go right ahead. Plant your feet firmly on the floor and the heels of your hands firmly on the dough in front of you. A dining table will usually be a more comfortable height than a kitchen counter, which may be too high. With all your strength, and leaning in with your whole body, push the dough forward hard with the heel of one hand, then with the heel of the other hand. Then fold it over and continue the movement, alternating hands—or whatever works for you. You're pushing the whole piece of dough forward, so it moves on the board. After each completed movement, give the dough a quarter turn and repeat. Keep this up for 30 minutes, or as long as you can stand. If you've used the food processor, 15 or 20 minutes will do. You can quit early, too, if you plan to use a rolling machine: send the dough through one extra pass for each minute of kneading saved. As you work, the dough may seem dry, but you don't want it to be wet and sticky. It needs just enough moisture to hold it together, not a drop more. If your dough is so dry that you are quite sure it will never hold together, you can add a teensy bit of water. (It used to be quite normal to use water to save eggs, which could be sold for cash.) Your goal is a single smooth loaf of dough that is not sticky to the touch. If the flour is either very freshly ground (hence moister) or very old (drier), you'll have to adjust by feel. When it feels just right—moist but not tacky, considerably drier than the average dog's nose—set it aside for a moment. You'll probably need to clean the board about halfway through the process. Use a plastic scraper or the blunt side of a large knife to scrape up any bits that have stuck to the board. (Sharp knives may damage your nice wooden board, and their edges are dulled by scraping.) Likewise wash your hands, which are doubtless also encrusted with bits of dried dough by this time.\n",

      " Pasta Acqua e Farina (Flour-and-Water Dough)  1 pound (450 grams) sifted durum wheat flour or semolina (semolino di grano duro); 1 cup (200 milliliters) water in a measuring cup, plus some extra if needed; extra flour for dusting and adjusting Hand method: Sift the flour onto a large wooden board.

      "For the braciole: Defrost, drain, and wring the frozen organic spinach dry in a clean kitchen towel and separate with your fingertips while adding to a mixing bowl. Season the spinach with salt, black pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, currants, pine nuts, finely chopped garlic, and cheese to the bowl and gently combine. Season the meat with salt and pepper and arrange each steak with one of the narrow ends near you. Divide the filling evenly among the meat slices. Scatter the filling over the meat leaving a 1/2-inch edge or border on the sides. Fold the edge over the filling and tuck in the edges as you roll each bundle to secure the filling. Wrap and roll the remaining bundles and secure with kitchen twine to cover the ends and middle, like wrapping a package.\n",

Add the chopped carrots, onions, sliced garlic, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables cook 5 minutes to soften, then stir in the chopped rosemary and sage for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir to develop the fragrance, then add the white wine and scrape up the pan drippings. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon or potato masher. Bring the sauce to a bubble, add the meat back to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours more, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "After 2 hours, brown the sausages in a frying pan with a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the browned links to the sauce and gently submerge them, nestling them in with the meat bundles. Simmer the mixture 30 minutes more to cook the sausages through and combine their flavor into the sauce.\n",

      "At once, and 1 by 1, tap an egg gently all over on a hard surface to crack the shell and starting at the large end, peel under a thin stream of cold water. Return it to the iced water, and continue with the rest. Let them chill a good 20 minutes in the iced water?rapid cooling helps prevent the dark line between yolk and white.\n",
      "Always store hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator, submerged in ice water in an uncovered container, where they will keep perfectly 3 to 4 days.\n",

Peel while still hot, halve them, cut into slices 1/4-inch thick.\n",
      "In a 2-quart bowl, combine salt, shallots, wine, and water. Lift the potatoes gently into a the 2-quart bowl. Using a bulb baster, so as not to break the slices, baste the potatoes with the liquid. Taste for seasoning adding more salt, if needed, grinds of pepper, and several spoonfuls of the olive oil. Baste several times as the potatoes cool.\n",
      "In a large kettle, set over moderately high heat, bring 6 quarts of water to the boil. Wash and drain the green beans, then snap off both ends. Add 2 tablespoons of salt to the boiling water and drop the beans into the kettle. Cover the kettle for a moment, just until it boils again. Uncover at once and boil slowly (moderate bubbles) for 3 to 4 minutes. The beans are done when just cooked through?taste one to be sure?just tender with the slightest crunch. Drain immediately. At once return the beans to the kettle and run cold water into it to cool the beans rapidly, adding a tray or two of ice cubes if you have them. When chilled, in 5 minutes or so, drain again, dry in a clean towel, and refrigerate in a covered bowl until ready to assemble salad.\n",
      "Separate the lettuce leaves, wash, and spin dry. Shortly before serving so that all elements will remain at their freshest, toss the lettuce leaves in a large bowl with just enough dressing to coat them. Taste the potatoes, adding a little more seasoning if necessary. Halve the eggs. Toss the green beans with a spoonful of the dressing. Lightly salt the cut surfaces of the tomatoes and dribble over a little dressing. Open and drain the anchovies, separating them with a form. Drain the canned tuna, flake gently, and season with lemon juice and pepper. Arrange the largest lettuce leaves nicely around the sides of the serving bowl or platter, and make a bed of the remaining leaves in the center, where you will pile the potatoes. Place the egg yolks against the lower part of the potatoes, spoon a dollop of mayonnaise over each yolk, and decorate with crossed strips of anchovies and a sprinkling of capers.

Season the spinach with salt, black pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, currants, pine nuts, finely chopped garlic, and cheese to the bowl and gently combine. Season the meat with salt and pepper and arrange each steak with one of the narrow ends near you. Divide the filling evenly among the meat slices. Scatter the filling over the meat leaving a 1/2-inch edge or border on the sides. Fold the edge over the filling and tuck in the edges as you roll each bundle to secure the filling. Wrap and roll the remaining bundles and secure with kitchen twine to cover the ends and middle, like wrapping a package.\n",

      "For the sauce: Remove the bundles from the pan and add 1 tablespoon more olive oil, give a turn of the pan to coat. Add the chopped carrots, onions, sliced garlic, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables cook 5 minutes to soften, then stir in the chopped rosemary and sage for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir to develop the fragrance, then add the white wine and scrape up the pan drippings. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon or potato masher. Bring the sauce to a bubble, add the meat back to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours more, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "After 2 hours, brown the sausages in a frying pan with a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the browned links to the sauce and gently submerge them, nestling them in with the meat bundles. Simmer the mixture 30 minutes more to cook the sausages through and combine their flavor into the sauce.\n",
